At this time, the game only works as a small demonstration of how Unity's GAS works. Uses two buttons
(Q and R) to level a Health stat and Stamina stat, both stored as Attributes in the ASC. See C++ files
for specific implementation. Blueprint classes were only used to set default values for the C++ classes
they inherit from. The exception to this is the HUD blueprints, which were used to display
the stats (in real time) and basic instructions in front of the player camera.
